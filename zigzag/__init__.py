    Finds the peaks and valleys of a series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : This is your series.
    up_thresh : The minimum relative change necessary to define a peak.
    down_thesh : The minimum relative change necessary to define a valley.

    Returns
    -------
    an array with 0 indicating no pivot and -1 and 1 indicating valley and peak

    Using Pandas
    ------------
    For the most part, X may be a pandas series. However, the index must

    each element where t is in [0,n).

    The First and Last Elements
    ---------------------------
    The first and last elements are guaranteed to be annotated as peak or
    valley even if the segments formed do not have the necessary relative
    changes. This is a tradeoff between technical correctness and the
    propensity to make mistakes in data analysis. The possible mistake is
    ignoring data outside the fully realized segments, which may bias analysis.
